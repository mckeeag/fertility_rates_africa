"The total fertility rate is the number of children that would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of
her child-bearing years and give birth to children at the current age-specific fertility rates" (Our World in Data, 2023).

This is a choropleth map that provides a visual representation of fertility rates in Africa in 2022. Darker shades of red indicate higher fertility rates, and lighter shades of orange indicate lower fertility rates.
